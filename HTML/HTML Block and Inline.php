<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically 
add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
<div>A block-level element always takes up the full width available.</div>
</p>
<p> An inline element is the opposite of the block-level element. It does not <span> on a new line and takes up only the necessary width.</span>
