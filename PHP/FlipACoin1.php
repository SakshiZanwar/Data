    	<pre>Before the loop, variables are defined to count the number of consecutive heads, $headCount, and the total number of flips, $flipCount.
The loop executes as long as $headCount is less than 3. Inside the loop rand(0,1) randomly 
outputs either a 0 or 1 representing tails and heads respectively, and $flipCount increases 
by one. If the result is heads (1 evaluates as true) $headCount increases by one and the heads 
<div>is echoed to the page. If not, $headCount becomes 0 and the tails is echoed to the page.

When the loop is done, $flipCount is echoed to the page within a paragraph.
